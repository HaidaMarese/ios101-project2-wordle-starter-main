# Project 2 - *Wordle Game*

Submitted by: **Haida Makouangou**

**Wordle Game** is an app that allows users to play a customizable version of the popular word-guessing game. Users can change the number of letters per row, set the number of rows for guesses, select a theme for the goal word, and toggle "alien wordle" mode to change the goal word after each guess.

Time spent: **144** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the number of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Users can view the game statistics such as number of guesses made and the theme of the goal word.

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
- Figuring out how to reset the board with the current settings while retaining the goal word was a bit tricky. I had to ensure that all settings could be applied again without affecting the goal word unless explicitly changed by the user.
